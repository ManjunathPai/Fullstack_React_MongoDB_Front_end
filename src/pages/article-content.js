      `Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language 
      that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
      It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application 
      developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code 
      can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
      Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any 
      Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
      The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities 
      than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as 
        reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in 
        traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular 
        programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for 
        client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21].`,

      `React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end 
      JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained 
      by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.React can be used
      as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is 
      only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating 
      React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well 
      as certain client-side functionality.`,
